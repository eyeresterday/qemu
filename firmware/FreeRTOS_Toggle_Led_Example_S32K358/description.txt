1. Example Description
    LED - toggled using Siul2_Dio_Ip driver and configure other pins using Siul2_Port_Ip driver (Pins tool)
    1.1 The application software functionality
        LED control with write channel

2. Installation steps
    2.1 Hardware installation
        2.1.1 Supported boards
            - XS32K3X8CVB-Q289 PCB 53108 RevX3 SCH RevA1 (Daughter card)
            - X-S32K3XXX-MB PCB 47386 RevA SCH (Motherboard)
        2.1.2 Connections
            - The level of PTA0 shall be flipped.
        2.1.3 Debugger
            The debugger must be connected to J205 20-pin JTAG Cortex Debug connector.
    2.2 Software installation
        2.2.1 Importing the S32 Design Studio project
            After opening S32 Design Studio, go to "File -> New -> S32DS Project From Example" and select this example. Then click on "Finish".
            The project should now be copied into your current workspace.

3. Generating, building and running the example application
    3.1 Generating the S32 configuration
        Before running the example a configuration needs to be generated.  First go to Project Explorer View in S32 DS and select the current project. Select the "S32 Configuration Tool" menu then click on the desired configuration tool (Pins, Cocks, Peripherals etc...). Clicking on any one of those will generate all the components. Make the desired changes (if any) then click on the "S32 Configuration Tool->Update Code" button.
    3.2 Compiling the application
        Select the configuration to be built: FLASH (Debug_FLASH) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the build button in eclipse.
        Use Project > Build to build the project.
        Wait for the build action to be completed before continuing to the next step. Check the compiler console for error messages; upon completion, the *.elf binary file should be created.
        3.3 Running the application on the board
        3.3.1 Running with PEmicro
            Go to Run and select Debug Configurations. There will be a debug configuration for this project:

            Configuration Name                                                  Description
            -------------------------------                                     -----------------------
            $(example)_S32K358_Debug_RAM_PNE                                    Debug the RAM configuration using PEmicro probe
            $(example)_S32K358_Debug_FLASH_PNE                                  Debug the FLASH configuration using PEmicro probe

            Select the desired debug configuration and click on Launch. Now the perspective will change to the Debug Perspective.
            Use the controls to control the program flow.
        3.3.2 Running with Lauterbach
            To execute the example application load the executable file to the evaluation board using the Lauterbach debugger and the debug_t32/run.cmm script.
            Run debug_t32/run.cmm script using T32 Lauterbach debugger.

            Configuration Name                                                  Description
            -------------------------------                                     -----------------------
            &load_to="flash"                                                    Target memory: flash
            &elf_file="../Debug_FLASH/$(example)_S32K358"                       Path to elf file

            EX: Config run with core_m7_0 and lockstep mode default
                DO s32k358.cmm &load_to &elf_file
        Use the controls to control the program flow.
